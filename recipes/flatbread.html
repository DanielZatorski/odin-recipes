    <p>
            <strong>Hvít Brauð</strong>, literally meaning “white bread” in Icelandic, is a soft, slightly sweet, and fluffy loaf 
            that's a staple in Icelandic households. Made with simple ingredients—usually wheat flour, milk or water, sugar, yeast, 
            and a bit of salt—it’s known for its tender crumb and golden-brown crust. The dough is typically enriched with milk and 
            sometimes a touch of butter or oil, giving it a rich and comforting flavor.
        </p>

        <p>
            This bread is often baked in a rectangular loaf pan, resulting in a tall, uniform shape perfect for slicing. It’s commonly 
            enjoyed with butter, cheese, or jam, and is especially popular at breakfast or during afternoon coffee breaks 
            (<em>kaffitími</em>). Some Icelanders associate it with childhood and comfort, evoking memories of home-cooked meals and 
            family gatherings.
        </p>

        <p>
            While not as rustic or hearty as rye-based Icelandic breads like <em>rúgbrauð</em>, Hvít Brauð offers a soft and mild contrast, 
            making it a versatile choice for everyday use.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Make the dough</strong></p>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Knead the dough</strong></p>
            <p>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
        <li>
            <p><strong>First dough rise</strong></p>
            <p>Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 60–90 minutes, or until doubled in size</p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p><strong>Shape and Second Rise</strong></p>
            <p>Punch down the dough, shape into a loaf (or two smaller loaves), and place in a greased loaf pan (or on a parchment-lined baking sheet if free-form). Cover and let rise for again for about 30 to 45 minutes until puffy.</p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p><strong>Preheat the oven</strong></p>
            <p>Preheat to 180°C (350°F).</p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p><strong>Optional Egg Wash and Topping</strong></p>
            <p>Brush the top with a beaten egg and sprinkle with seeds if desired.</p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p><strong>Bake</strong></p>
            <p>Bake for 30–40 minutes (25–30 if making two smaller loaves), until golden brown and it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Internal temp should be around 90°C (195°F).</p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p><strong>Cool</strong></p>
            <p>Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and cool on a rack.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
