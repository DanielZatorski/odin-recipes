    <p>
        <strong>Mead</strong> (<em>Mjöður</em> in Old Norse) is an ancient honey-based alcoholic beverage enjoyed by Norsemen, Celts, and other early cultures 
        throughout Europe. Often referred to as “the drink of the gods,” mead features prominently in Viking sagas and mythology—believed to bestow wisdom, 
        strength, and poetic inspiration.
    </p>

    <p>
        Made by fermenting honey with water (sometimes with added herbs, fruits, or spices), mead ranges from dry to sweet, still to sparkling. The version below 
        is a simple and traditional style that echoes the rustic character of early Norse brewing—no modern additives, just raw ingredients and patience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though mead can be enjoyed after just a few weeks, its flavor deepens with age. Brew some for your next Viking feast or solstice celebration!

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Sanitize your equipment</strong></p>
            <p>Before starting, clean and sanitize all tools—fermenter, spoon, airlock, funnel, etc.—to prevent contamination.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Mix the must</strong></p>
            <p>In a large pot or directly in your fermenter, combine the honey and warm (not hot) water. Stir until fully dissolved. Add herbs or fruit if using.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cool and pitch yeast</strong></p>
            <p>Ensure the mixture is at room temperature (20–25°C / 68–77°F), then add (pitch) the yeast. Stir gently to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Seal and ferment</strong></p>
            <p>Pour into a sanitized fermentation vessel and attach an airlock. Store in a cool, dark place. Fermentation typically takes 2–4 weeks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Secondary fermentation (optional)</strong></p>
            <p>After bubbling slows, you may rack (transfer) the mead to a clean container, leaving sediment behind, and age it for 1–3 months for clarity and flavor development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Bottle</strong></p>
            <p>Once fermentation is complete and the mead is clear, bottle it using sanitized bottles and store in a cool place. Carbonation is optional (requires priming sugar before bottling).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Age and enjoy</strong></p>
            <p>Mead is drinkable after a few weeks but improves significantly with age. Best enjoyed after 3–6 months, or even longer!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
